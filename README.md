Learning the ropes

Hi work lovers. 

Dan here. I love stats and R, despite not being good at either. One day I'll write an R package that will be used by used by at least 4 people. Number of teaching awards won = zero. Number of research awards won = zero. Number of honorable mentions = zero. Rate my professor ratings = 1, and it's not very good. One day I hope to break through the middle.
